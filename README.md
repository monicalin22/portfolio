# Monica's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Monica and I am currently a rising senior at Columbia University.
I am interested in Product Design, so I thought that it would be good to get some practice in with front-end development.
As such, I coded my website. (I wireframed & prototyped my website in Figma and Webflow. I also tried to use
Twitter Bootstrap for responsiveness.)

Thank you for visiting!
