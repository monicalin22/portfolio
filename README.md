# Monica's Portfolio

Hi, my name is Monica and I am currently a rising senior at Columbia University.
I am interested in Product Design, so I thought that it would be good to get some practice in with front-end development.
I have coded all the HTML/CSS of my website myself but did need some help with the JavaScript and so I used WebFlow's 
animation/JavaScript library for some help with that. (I wireframed & prototyped my website in Figma and Webflow.)

Thank you for visiting!
