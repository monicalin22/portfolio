Though Word is incredibly useful when it comes to drafting documents, it has no built-in function to open tabs in place of new windows, often resulting in cluttered screens. To solve this user experience issue, I added a feature that allows documents to be opened as tabs.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-18">Understanding the Problem</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-18">As college student, I write a lot of papers. I’ve always had difficulty organizing and finding documents, though, because multiple Word files were opened in different windows. I complained to my roommate about this, and she felt similarly, agreeing that tabs as an added feature would improve our user experience. Surely, my roommate and I were not alone.<br><br>So, to gauge how others felt about this idea, I conducted general research and interviewed 6 people to get their opinions regarding Microsoft Word. I spoke to 3 fellow classmates, 1 teaching assistant, 1 professor, and also 1 employee at a tech startup.<br><br>The main takeaways that I discovered were:<strong>‍</strong>‍</p>
      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item">‍<strong>Everyone uses Microsoft Word, </strong>and they’ve all been familiar with it for as long as they’ve known. They have been alongside Word for much of its UI/UX transformations.<br></li>
        <li class="list-item">The UI/UX of the program is <strong>mostly intuitive</strong>, and most interviewees said the application has improved greatly over the years.</li>
        <li class="list-item">‍<strong>Comments are difficult to add, </strong>and all my interviewees used this feature at least sometimes.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Word’s main competitor is Google Docs.</strong> Interviewees liked Google Docs because of the easy sharing capability, efficient commenting system, and the ability to keep multiple documents in the same window. Some students, though, thought that the UI/UX and advanced features were lacking.</li>
        <li class="list-item">I asked users if they felt that they had too many Word documents open at times, and all of them stated that whether they were writing essays, copy, or any other written content, <strong>sometimes, they had to reference other documents, making their screens busy and difficult to navigate.</strong></li>
        <li class="list-item-6">Finally, when asked about what features they would implement to improve Word, they mentioned an improved commenting system or <strong>adding tabs to help declutter digital workspaces.</strong> (For my UI/UX design project, I will be implementing the latter, which is adding tabs as a feature in Word.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph-18">Below is a visualization of how difficult it can be when you are trying to navigate between documents on Microsoft Word.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-18">Stakeholder Map</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-18">After doing some research, I mapped stakeholders into 4 groups. These groups are focused on the users of Microsoft Word. They are <strong>students, academic professionals, business professionals, and all others.<br><br>‍</strong>Taking a look at the map, you can see that all users engage with Microsoft Word to do some kind of written work. Students often write essays, business professionals write documents ranging from conference notes to contracts to journal articles, academic professionals write research papers and lecture notes, and others, such as parents who want to create birthday cards, etc.<br><br>Clearly, then, having Word be as efficient as it can be is quite important.</p>

      <ul role="list">
        <li class="list-item">‍<strong>Google Docs: </strong>Most similar to Word.<strong> </strong>Online so allows for easy sharing, commenting, and collaboration. Seems easier to use than Word at first glance. Documents can be opened in the same web browser or different ones.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Pages:</strong> Most similar to Google Docs and Word. Not as complex as either. Offers tabs in the same window. Just usable enough features to get by, but feels rather simplistic.</li>
        <li class="list-item">‍<strong>Notes on MacBook: </strong>Rather simple. For projects that are not complex. Quick and convenient. Organized by notes as tabs and folders.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Evernote: </strong>Very similar to “Notes,” but a bit more complex. Notes organized by folders, favorites, and tabs. All in the same browser.</li>
        <li class="list-item"><strong>Adobe Acrobat Pro:</strong> Not a word processing application, but allows users to read documents. Has tabs and editing tools. Organized mainly by different features. Quite complex.</li>
        <li class="list-item-6"><strong>Office Tabs: </strong>A feature that adds tabs to all Word products, but does not inherently come with Microsoft Word. Must be downloaded outside of the application. Not a well-known feature. Hard to find unless you’re specifically looking for it. (Will not be graphed.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="paragraph-19">Below, you can see a graphic that I created to compare how complex and organized these applications are. This graph shows that, of the products I researched, <strong>all applications working with real documents, not just notes, have adequate organizational features, such as tabs.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="heading-18">Personas</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-18">Below, I created three examples for what kind of users my function would target. Overall, though, I think that everyone who uses Word could benefit from this function, so the age range of the audience most likely encompasses anyone whose old enough to use a computer and word processing application. This group would include those I indicated earlier in my stakeholder map.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-18">Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-18">After drawing out some of my ideas on paper as low-fidelity wireframes, I went right into high-fidelity wireframing. I did this in Sketch, then moved my file to Figma. (I did not go through the process of low-fidelity wireframing in Sketch because the project was rather brief and simple.) Though tabs as an added feature makes an incredible difference in the lives of users, the solution itself didn’t require that many screens. I just needed to add one feature, I utilized screenshots of an already existing project.<br><br>Below, you can see a visual of the interactions I created between screens, overlays, and symbols. (Two of the screens represent different files with corresponding tabs.)</p>

        <h2 class="heading-18">Usability Testing</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-18">After finishing up my wireframe and prototype, I tested the usability of my new added feature with 5 students, 3 of whom I originally interviewed and 2 close friends.<br><br>From this activity, I learned that:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li class="list-item"><strong>Users really liked this idea and could clearly see the utility in it. </strong>They asked why Microsoft Words didn’t have a feature to add tabs already.</li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong>Users thought that my design was intuitive, clear, and in line with how the feature looks on other apps.</strong> Locating where the tab feature is was simple as they just moved towards the usual button that opened new documents.</li>
          <li class="list-item">‍<strong>Notes on MacBook: </strong>Rather simple. For projects that are not complex. Quick and convenient. Organized by notes as tabs and folders.</li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong>Users felt that this feature would help them keep their documents organized. </strong>The main purpose of my project was to make sure that users felt less cluttered and more efficient when they used Microsoft Word. All interviewees displayed great enthusiasm that my feature would help them feel exactly that.</li>
          <li class="list-item"><strong>Users wondered what the screen would look like if there were more tabs than could fit on the blue bar. </strong>Would they stack or would it appear similar to how Google Chrome organizes its tabs? (Personally, I would design something that is similar to the latter.)</li>
          <li class="list-item-6"><strong>Users wondered if there was a feature to open files as tabs in the same window as well. </strong>Though this was not part of my original wireframe and prototype, it is an important feature that I accounted for in one of my storyboard scenarios.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="div-block-56">
      <h2 class="heading-18">The Final Product &amp; Implemented Solution</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-18">After conducting my usability test, I put together my final prototype. You can see an animation of it below! Click anywhere on the visual to be taken to the Figma prototype so you can interact with it yourself.<br><br>To access “New Tab,” simply go to File &gt; New Document &gt; New Tab. Under “New Document,” users can also find the “New Window” option if that’s what they’d prefer.<br><br>‍<em>(A feature such as opening files as tabs instead of just new files would look similar. A user should click File &gt; Open/Open Recent to select the files they wish to upload. Afterwards, a message should pop-up asking the user if they want these files opened in multiple windows or as multiple tabs in one window.) </em></p>
