        <h3 class="heading-23">Business Overview</h3>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Company Details</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">Pilota is an early-stage startup that is backed by Cornell Tech, 500 Startups, and Plug and Play. They use AI to predict trends using Google Flights&#x27; API data. After two years, they launched their first product, FlySafe, this summer. It offers users the ability to compare the safety metrics of flights and save them for future reference. The company has been mentioned in Fortune 500, Forbes, TechCrunch, PhocusWire, Tech:NYC, and more!<br><br>Below, I&#x27;ve included an overview of Pilota&#x27;s style guide.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-24">Product Details</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">Pilota wants to create products that seamlessly take users through the process of booking flights, and FlySafe is especially important right now because millions of people across the world no longer feel safe flying given the current pandemic. FlySafe is unique in that there are no other products like this offered so conveniently as a Chrome extension. They champion a usable product design inspired by SaaS and minimalism.<br><br>Below is a GIF of a tour that I created for the extension (accessible from the icon in the Chrome menu bar). I&#x27;ve included it here to give you a better idea of how the extension works. </p>
        <div class="div-block-75"><img src="pilota-assets/TourGuide.gif" alt="" class="image-39"></div>
        <h4 class="heading-24">My Role &amp; Projects</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">At Pilota, I am a UI/UX Product Design intern. So far, I&#x27;ve redesigned Pilota&#x27;s landing page, FlySafe&#x27;s flight detail page, the on-boarding experience, the COVID-19 dashboard, and the FAQ page. I am the only UI/UX designer on the team, and I work closely with the CEO, CTO, graphic designer, and front-end development team to improve Pilota&#x27;s user experience, which is super important because the process of booking, to be better than it currently is, must be as simplified and seamless as possible. Finding the right flight can be difficult, and FlySafe&#x27;s UI/UX must reflect that the product is here to help.<br><br>The design processes I went through were a bit informal as I did not get to empathize or test with users with each project I was assigned, but because this startup was just about to launch its first product, the timeline was rather quick. Of course, we still conducted user testing for the extension as a whole and are currently A/B testing some new features. The E-Board and myself (which is 5 people in total) took care of user and A/B testing.<br></p>

        <h3 class="heading-23">Landing Page Redesign</h3>
        <h6 class="heading-25">June 1 - June 8</h6>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Research</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">My first assignment was to redesign <a href="https://www.flypilota.com/" target="_blank" class="link-25">Pilota&#x27;s landing page</a> before their soft launch. To begin, I conducted research because I wanted to learn more about best practices for increasing conversion rates.<br><br>I learned that because the landing page is the first thing that a user sees about a product, it is important to not feature anything besides the call-to-action (CTA), which in Pilota&#x27;s case, is downloading the extension. The best ratio of other actions to the call to action is 1:1. (Pilota&#x27;s original landing page had an attention ratio of 9:1, so this was definitely something I wanted to change.) It is also important for a landing page to communicate its product&#x27;s unique selling points; what about this product is special, beneficial, or worthwhile?<br><br>Next, I learned that it is good to have social proof, meaning that users want to see that a product is trustworthy. To do this, landing pages can include quotes, reviews, social shares, statistics, testimonials, referrals, and more. Quotes, reviews, and social shares add a bit more of personability while numbers can add tangible credibility.<br><br>Though a lot of what I learned was in-line with a lot of other design principles I already knew, there were some surprising findings. For example, in a PDF by Unbounce titled, &quot;7 Principles of Conversion-Centered Design,&quot; they found that CTA&#x27;s without the word “free” converted, on average, 16.8% better than those with it. <br></p>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">Next, I took a look at the landing pages of other companies. Though there were some variations in attention ratios, most of them repeated the CTA multiple times and offered unique perspectives regarding their product. (Also, all of them mentioned their products were free if they were.) Specifically, I took a deeper look at the landing pages for other Chrome extensions, despite what product was being offered because I wanted to better understand the user flows of landing pages. <br><br>I researched Fakespot, Web of Trust, Grammarly, and Honey. I&#x27;ve included the latter two in the graphic below because they are some of the most popular Chrome extensions available.</p>
        <div class="div-block-71"><img src="images/CA-Redone.png" srcset="images/CA-Redone-p-500.png 500w, images/CA-Redone-p-800.png 800w, images/CA-Redone-p-1080.png 1080w, images/CA-Redone.png 2060w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, (max-width: 991px) 728px, 940px" alt=""></div>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Wireframing &amp; Prototyping</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">I began my design with sketches and then wireframes. Before I put in the actual content, I spent some time trying to structure the website properly. I ran through a couple of iterations with the team, and afterwards, spent some time on copy, graphics, and content.<br><br>Below you can see my design in action. (The original attention ratio was 2:1, but now, it is 3:1 because of the &quot;Try It Out&quot; function. I was assigned to add this feature a couple of weeks after my initial redesign, and I will explain it more in-depth in a later section.)</p>
        <div class="div-block-73"><img src="pilota-assets/PilotaLandingPage.gif" alt="" class="image-35"></div>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Results &amp; Concluding Thoughts</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">Though simple, the landing page is an incredibly important page for a product. It needs to be short and to the point while also grabbing the user&#x27;s attention and selling its product well. It was a bit difficult trying to optimize the SEO of Pilota&#x27;s landing page because I could not have too much content on the page itself, but I made use of information hierarchy through heading styles, popular keywords about flights, alternative text for images, and more. I also designed the mobile version of the page on Wix directly.<br><br>So far, the landing page seems to be performing well! The product was launched the week of July 12, and since then, we&#x27;ve had a conversion rate of 32.54%.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-23">Flight Details Page Design</h3>
        <h6 class="heading-25">June 11 - June 15</h6>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Goals</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">The next assignment I had was to design <a href="https://app.flypilota.com/dashboard/flysafe/?legs=%5B%7B%22flightNumber%22:%22DL3501%22,%22depAirport%22:%22LAX%22,%22arrAirport%22:%22SFO%22,%22depDate%22:%222020-08-05%22,%22arrDate%22:%222020-08-05%22,%22depTime%22:%227:45%20AM%22,%22arrTime%22:%229:03%20AM%22,%22minutesEnroute%22:78,%22price%22:%22$107%22,%22legId%22:%22LAXSFODL35012020-08-05%22,%22language%22:%22en%22,%22currency%22:%22USD%22%7D%5D&amp;measureSettings=%5B%22Air%20Filtration%22,%22Capacity%20Capping%22,%22Provided%20PPE%22,%22Flexible%20Policies%22,%22Cabin%20Sanitization%22%5D" target="_blank" class="link-24">Pilota&#x27;s &quot;Flight Details&quot; page</a>. Essentially, this is the page that the user can get to from the tooltip to learn even more about their flight. Such information will supplement the safety information already presented to them through the tooltip&#x27;s summary. I wanted the page&#x27;s design to be consistent with Pilota&#x27;s brand, and I also wanted to create a minimalistic, usable, and scalable design so that the engineers could add more features later.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Wireframe &amp; Prototype</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">I created wireframes and prototypes for the flight details page, available in both the desktop and mobile view. I wanted the page to be easy to read and understand, so I put each safety metric in its own box. To make the page more unique and stylish, I put the details of a flight in a boarding pass! (Though this information is available on Google Flights, it is kept here to remind the user what they&#x27;re looking at.) Additionally, there is a lot of copy and content to reassure the user that Pilota&#x27;s product is unique and reliable, such as the health rating that appears first and Pilota&#x27;s recommendation of the flight.<br><br>Because Pilota&#x27;s product is a Chrome extension, it is actually not accessible on mobile. Their landing page, though, does have a feature where you can try out FlySafe, so I built out a mobile friendly version that is also meant to capture conversions. I added a button that says &quot;Get FlySafe&quot; which links to a lightbox that asks for the users&#x27; email. This way, they can save the extension for later, and at worst, they don&#x27;t download it in the moment but are still exposed to our product.</p>

        <h4 class="heading-24">User Feedback &amp; Next Steps</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">I was able to user test the flight details page with 4 users myself and received feedback from 36 users overall (explained more in detail in the next section). Most users thought that the page was minimalistic, pretty, and easy to read. One piece of feedback was the the color of the filled-in stars was not consistent from the tooltip to flight details page. Additionally, users also wanted to see the price of the ticket on the flight&#x27;s detail summary. These changes were implemented before the soft launch, and I incorporated them into the mobile version straight away as it was designed a bit later.<br></p>
      </div>
      <div class="div-block-68">
        <h3 class="heading-23">User Testing for the Extension</h3>
        <h6 class="heading-25">June 16 - June 20</h6>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Goals</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">In our user tests, we wanted to track the how quickly users got the hang of certain features and the user flow to ensure that the application is as easy to use as possible. The E-Board and I sat down with users who had signed up to interview individually. We walked with them through the entire process, asking questions along the way to gage the users&#x27; journey and feelings. The team had gained valuable insights from user testing before, but this is the last round we would do before the soft launch of our product.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Interviews I Conducted</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">Personally, I interviewed 4 people. Each interview took place through a FaceTime call, and I asked every user to download the extension while speaking with them as they found certain functions. I asked them about accessing certain features, and they were all able to do so. Examples include asking if they knew how to save a flight or view more details. I also asked if they felt overwhelmed, confused, or comfortable while using the extension. Everyone said that they had no difficulty using the extension and saw great utility in it.<br>‍<br>Most of the feedback that could be implemented was about missing features. For instance, the first iteration of the flight details page, as I mentioned above, did not have the flight&#x27;s price. This was quickly fixed before the soft launch.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Results</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">We implemented the following changes based on user feedback:<br></p>
        <ul role="list" class="list">
          <li class="list-item-7">Indication to the user that a flight has been saved by keeping the heart icon on the tooltip filled in after they navigated away and back to the same flight&#x27;s tooltip. (This was more of a front-end issue, so user testing was helpful with debugging, too.)</li>
          <li class="list-item-9">A price added to the flight details page.</li>
          <li class="list-item-8">Organization of the containers on the flight detail page with the missing safety features first so that the user can see the reasons why this flight has a lower safety rating upfront.</li>
          <li class="list-item-10">Transparency with the safety ratings. Why do some have only 2 stars when they have 3/6 measures implemented? (3/6 did not seem that bad to many users.)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="div-block-68">
        <h3 class="heading-23">Flight Search Feature</h3>
        <h6 class="heading-25">June 22</h6>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Goals</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">The E-Board asked me to design a feature that would allow users to search for flights and see FlySafe in action from Pilota&#x27;s landing page. The point of this feature was to show users what FlySafe was like so that they would be more familiar with it, see its uniqueness, and be more willing to download it. Adding this feature to the landing page, though, would increase the number of actionable items there. Moving forward, I needed to design something that did not distract too much from the CTA of downloading the Chrome extension. After all, this function was only meant to be a complement to the CTA that could draw in more users.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-24">Prototype</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-25">I created two different designs. The first prompted the user to put in three different data points and then click &quot;Search.&quot; The second was more refined and only prompted the user to enter in one out of three data points; after clicking &quot;Search,&quot; they would be prompted to enter in the other two. This way, they would not be overwhelmed in their first impression of the landing page and more attention would still be focused on the &quot;ADd to Chrome&quot; button. They could engage further with the demo <em>after</em> knowing they would like to try it out.</p>
        <div class="div-block-76"><img src="pilota-assets/FlightSearch.gif" alt="" class="image-41"></div>
        <h4 class="heading-24">A/B Testing</h4>
        <p class="paragraph-32">Because we wanted to see which version would perform the best, I conducted some A/B testing. Wix actually has a feature that allows you to create a &quot;release candidate&quot; that can be shown to some percent of website visitors to test different versions of websites. I used this feature to create a landing page with only one actionable item, just the &quot;Try It Now&quot; button, and another with two actionable items, entering in the departure airport and clicking &quot;Find Flight.&quot; The website reached <br><br>The one with only a single click actually had a conversion rate that was 6% higher than the version that would prompt users to click twice. As such, we went with the former design, which is the one that is on the website currently.</p>
