      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">For our first design, we just wanted to get our ideas our there. As such, it was rather simple. 
          We decided that a main graph was important visually, centering that at the top. Moreover, we allowed users to customize 
          that graph as they so pleased. Lastly, we wanted to summarize trends in the data so users 
          could quickly understand changes over time and use that to check in on healthcare workers. The colors used were the ones 
          Cress picked for their original applications.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-2">For our next iterations, we focused on more complex interactions. 
          For example, we looked deeper into the UI/UX of date-picking and saving reports. These interactions 
          required more involved thinking as we wanted the flow to be as smooth as possible. To ensure that users 
          could get the most out of the data, we also added a feature that allows users to compare to graphs at once. 
          Now, users could not only compare metrics over time on the same graph, but they could also compare such metrics 
          across graphs.</p>

      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">After some user and A/B tests, including two with the CEO and CFO, 
          we learned that users liked a large graph to be the first thing they saw. As such, we moved the 
          “Overview” to another tab and changed the view to better accomodate our feedback. <br><br>Some users also did not 
          like the original color scheme. They thought that it was too vibrant for a medical data dashboard, so we 
          worked with the mobile and branding teams to come up with a new, more mellow color scheme. <br><br>
          Lastly, in our final iteration, we decided on a simple date-picking system that’s charm would come from its interactions. 
          Below, you can see the user’s flow from adding metrics on a graph to saving that graph.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-3 _3rd">Insightful Comparisons</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-2">To empower our users even further, we decided to add a feature that 
        allows users to compare metrics across not only time, but also graphs. For example, this 
        would allow users to compare “Sleep” and “Emotions” from June 8, 2020 to June 15, 2020 and 
        also the same two metrics from June 8, 2019 to June 15, 2019 to see what has changed between 
        this year and last.
        <br><br>
        Because this feature can be quite complicated, we wanted to reserve an entire tab just for saved 
        graphs and comparisons under “Saved Reports.” When we originally tested with users, they said 
        that they would not be using this feature for more than 2 graphs most of the time, so we decided 
        to limit the comparisons in order to keep our dashboard user-friendly. They can either add a graph 
        to the comparison slot by typing in the name of a graph or dragging a graph to the allotted slot.</p>
      <div class="div-block-5"><img src="cress/Compare.gif" loading="lazy" alt="" class="border"></div>
      <div class="div-block-8">
        <h3 class="heading-3 _3rd">Overview of Data Trends</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph-2">The trend reports in our first designs included circles. I thought that, 
        once animated, these would be fun to look at, but that’s all they would be: eye candy. Our user 
        tests corroborated this sentiment as many users did not know why data was being packaged into circles. 
        They felt that bars or some other visual may be better for showing comparisons and trends among the 
        different metrics.<br><br>
        In our final iteration, we wanted to give users the freedom of customizing their trend reports while also 
        giving them quick shortcuts to select varying periods of time. The trend report is meant to compare all of 
        these metrics from one date to another. For example, in the prototype below, “Emotion” decreased by 1.83 
        from August 4 to August 5.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-2 end">We ran through a couple more A/B and user tests 
          to make sure the original feedback we received was applied properly. In the end, 
          we presented our design to 20 other design interns, our 2 managers, C-suite, and even 
          some potential clients. They all loved it and saw its value!</p>
        <h3 class="heading-3 _3rd">What I Learned</h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="paragraph-2">First, I learned about the importance of animations. 
          There obviously cannot be too many when the project is being delivered, but 
          animations can keep users engaged. I delved deeper into Principle. In fact, this was the first 
          project I've ever used drivers in!
          <br><br>
          In terms of process, I realized how important it is to understand one’s audience, 
          despite how much research exists on the internet for a certain feature (which was, in this case, 
          a dashboard.) Products should be perfectly tailored to their users every time! Our audience wanted to use insights 
          that were simple to read, and our product had a direct positive impact that I could feel. 
          Because of this, I reached an epitome about design: I am solving problems for other people and, 
          by doing so, making their lives a bit easier. In the end, I fell in love with design even more.</p>
